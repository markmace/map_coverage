# Map Coverage Tracker

A Python application to track street coverage from Strava activities using GPS data. See how much of your city you've explored on foot!

## Features

- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Activity Analysis**: Analyze running, biking, walking, or hiking activities
- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Maps**: Visualize your coverage with toggleable layers
- üìä **Granular Tracking**: Street segments instead of entire streets for more accurate coverage
- üèôÔ∏è **City Boundaries**: See your coverage within city limits
- üìà **Detailed Statistics**: Export coverage data and statistics

## Setup

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. To get started:

1. Install `uv` (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Usage

### Web Application (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this tool is through the web interface:

1. **Start the web server:**
   ```bash
   uv run python webapp.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Enter your city name** (e.g., "Somerville, Massachusetts, USA")

4. **Select activity type** (Run is the default)

5. **Specify your GPX directory** (defaults to `strava_runs`)

6. **Click "Analyze Coverage"** to see your results!

### Command Line Workflow

1. **Download your Strava activities:**
   ```bash
   uv run python strava_client.py
   ```
   This will download your activities as GPX files to the `strava_activities/` directory.

2. **Analyze street coverage:**
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py
   ```
   This will:
   - Load the city street network
   - Process your downloaded activities
   - Calculate coverage statistics
   - Generate an interactive map (`coverage_map.html`)
   - Export detailed statistics (`coverage_stats.json`)

## Strava API Setup

You need to set up Strava API access:

1. Create a Strava app at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
2. Get your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Create `strava_credentials.json` with:
   ```json
   {
       "strava_client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
       "strava_client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
   }
   ```

The app will automatically create `strava_access_tokens.json` when you first authenticate.

## How It Works

### Street Coverage Algorithm
- **Street Segmentation**: Streets are split into ~100-meter segments for granular tracking
- **GPS Buffer**: Your GPS tracks are buffered by 20 meters to account for GPS inaccuracy
- **Intersection Detection**: Segments that intersect with your buffered GPS tracks are marked as "covered"
- **Partial Coverage**: Only the parts of streets you actually ran on are counted

### Map Visualization
- **GPS Tracks**: Orange dashed lines showing your actual routes
- **Covered Streets**: Green solid lines showing streets you've "checked off"
- **Uncovered Streets**: Red solid lines showing streets you haven't run on
- **City Boundary**: Dark outline showing city limits
- **Interactive Controls**: Toggle layers on/off directly in the map
