# Map Coverage Tracker

A Python application to track street coverage from Strava activities using GPS data. See how much of your city you've explored on foot!

## What You Need

### 1. GPX Files
You need GPX files from your activities. You can get these by:
- **Strava Export**: Download your data from Strava's export feature
- **Strava API**: Use the included `strava_client.py` to download activities
- **Other Apps**: Any fitness app that exports GPX files

### 2. Strava API (Optional)
If you want to download activities directly, you'll need:
- Strava API credentials (see setup below)
- Or manually export your GPX files from Strava

## Setup

This project uses `uv` for dependency management:

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Get your GPX files** (choose one):
   - **Option A**: Use the Strava client (requires API setup below)
   - **Option B**: Manually export GPX files from Strava to a folder

### Strava API Setup (Optional)

If using the Strava client to download activities:

1. Create a Strava app at https://www.strava.com/settings/api
2. Get your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Create `strava_credentials.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "strava_client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
       "strava_client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Web Application (Recommended)

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   uv run python webapp.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Enter your city name** (e.g., "Somerville, Massachusetts, USA")

4. **Select activity type** (Run is the default)

5. **Specify your GPX directory** (where your .gpx files are stored)

6. **Click "Analyze Coverage"** to see your results!

### Command Line

If you prefer the command line:

1. **Download activities** (if using Strava API):
   ```bash
   uv run python strava_client.py
   ```

2. **Analyze coverage**:
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py [gpx_directory]
   ```

## Features

- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Activity Analysis**: Analyze running, biking, walking, or hiking activities
- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Maps**: Visualize your coverage with toggleable layers
- üìä **Granular Tracking**: Street segments instead of entire streets for more accurate coverage
- üìà **Detailed Statistics**: Export coverage data and statistics

## How It Works

### Street Coverage Algorithm
- **Street Segmentation**: Streets are split into ~100-meter segments for granular tracking
- **GPS Buffer**: Your GPS tracks are buffered by 20 meters to account for GPS inaccuracy
- **Intersection Detection**: Segments that intersect with your buffered GPS tracks are marked as "covered"
- **Partial Coverage**: Only the parts of streets you actually ran on are counted

### Map Visualization
- **GPS Tracks**: Orange dashed lines showing your actual routes
- **Covered Streets**: Green solid lines showing streets you've "checked off"
- **Uncovered Streets**: Red solid lines showing streets you haven't run on
- **City Boundary**: Dark outline showing city limits
- **Interactive Controls**: Toggle layers on/off directly in the map
